# About me

Welcome to everyone visiting this website! I'm the creator of this site. You can call me by my GitHub ID lz2951, or you can call my nickname Zilly! I'm currently a first-year master student majoring in Biostatistics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC). You can gain a deeper understanding of me by [reviewing my resume](Resume.html).

# About this website

This website was initially created as an assignment for an R data science course. Here, you can find my experiences in the form of a resume. If possible, I'll continue updating my other projects on this site in the future.

# Contact me

You can contact me via [email](lz2951@cumc.columbia.edu) or [GitHub](http://github.com/lz2951/). You can also find my addresses in website navigation bar which is on the very top of this page.
